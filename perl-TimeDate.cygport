NAME="perl-TimeDate"
VERSION=2.30
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl date parsing module"
DESCRIPTION="The date parser contained in this distribution is far superior to
the yacc based parser, and a *lot* faster. The parser contained here will only
parse absolute dates, if you want a date parser that can parse relative dates
then take a look at the Time modules by David Muir on CPAN."
